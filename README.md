# xmpp.js

> XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.

**xmpp.js** is a JavaScript library for [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/).

## Get started

- [client](/packages/client)
- [component](/packages/component)
- [xml](/packages/xml)
- [jid](/packages/jid)
- [time](/packages/time)
- [uri](/packages/uri)

## goals

### universal

It aims to run everywhere JavaScript runs and make use of the best network transport available.

xmpp.js is known to be used with Node.js, browsers, React Native, GJS and Duktape.

### reliable

By default, it handles errors and will automatically reconnect. With appropriate configuration it will even loop through a list of endpoints. You don't have to write a single line of code to handle network failures.

Releases follow the [Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org/)

### modular

Each feature is implemented as a module that can be added or removed easily. Including core XMPP features.

### small

We avoid third party dependencies.

For the web, we make the sure the default [client](/packages/client) doesn't exceed 15 kb (gzipped), for reference, that's less than half the size of [React](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html#reduced-file-size).
